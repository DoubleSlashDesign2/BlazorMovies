Life Cycle of a Component

OnInitialized and OnInitializedAsync
   Here we could trigger an http request to get the data from the server to be displayed.
--Executed only once - that is when the component loads

OnParametersSet and OnParametersSetAsync
   Are executed when the component has received all parameters and the values have been
   assigned to their properties.
 --These methods are executed everytime the parameters are updated

OnAfterRender and OnAfterRenderAsync
  Are execured when components are rendered and the html is already displayed on in the browser
  you can put code here to work with javascript libiries and html elements
--Executed after each time it rendered

ShouldRender
  We use should render to indicate if we want a componet to ( re-fire the OnAfterRender )
  after its initial render (ie. if it gets re-rendered by a javascript libs)
